# Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Log

**Status**: 🟡 In Progress  
**Dataset**: `data/raw.csv` (~2,000 Records)

> **Guardian Note**: EDA focuses exclusively on the tabular features for Module A. No NLP feature engineering is performed during this phase.

## 1. Distribution Analysis Observations
*(To be filled during analysis)*
- **Study Hours**: [Pending]
- **Sleep Hours**: [Pending]
- **Physical Activity**: [Pending]
- **Target (GPA - Module A)**: [Pending]
- **Target (Stress Level - Module B Architecture)**: [Pending]

## 2. Correlation Analysis
*(To be filled during analysis)*
- **Key Positive Correlations**: [Pending]
- **Key Negative Correlations**: [Pending]

## 3. "Risk Triad" Verification
- **Stress vs Sleep**: [Pending]
- **GPA vs Study Hours**: [Pending]
- **Stress vs Physical Activity**: [Pending]

## 4. Hypothesis Validation
| Hypothesis | Observation | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Low Sleep -> High Stress | [Observation] | [Pending] |
| High Study -> High Stress | [Observation] | [Pending] |
| Low Activity -> High Stress | [Observation] | [Pending] |
